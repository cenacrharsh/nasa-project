/* express is basically just a fancy listener function/middleware that we add on top our built in node http server */

/* any middleware or route handlers attached to app object will respond to requests coming in to our server */

/* using built in http server allows us to not only respond to http requests but also to other types of connections for eg. web sockets for real time communication  */
